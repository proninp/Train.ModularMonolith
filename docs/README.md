This repository is dedicated to practicing and applying the concepts from a two-part course on modular-monolith architecture in .NET.
It is intended solely for **study and training purposes**.

## What’s inside

* Hands-on exercises aligned with the course modules (from introductory to deep-dive levels)
* Sample projects and refactoring tasks to reinforce learning
* Space for your own implementations, notes and experiments

## Why this repository

* Solidify understanding of modular monolith architecture in .NET
* Build muscle memory through repeated, structured practice
* Create a personal reference of patterns and techniques you can revisit later
